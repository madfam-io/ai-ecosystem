This project is a static website generated by an autonomous front-end agent. The entire content, structure, and styling are derived from the provided research document, `RESEARCH.md`.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to automatically convert a detailed markdown research paper into a fully functional, responsive, and user-friendly static website. The website presents the "State of the AI Ecosystem: A Comprehensive Report for August 2025" in a clean, readable format.

## File Structure üìÇ

The project contains the following files:

* `RESEARCH.md`: The original source document containing all the text and data for the report. This file is the single source of truth.
* `index.html`: The main entry point of the website. It contains the semantic HTML structure for all the content from the report.
* `style.css`: This file contains all the styling rules. It ensures the website is professional, readable, and responsive across all devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop).
* `script.js`: This file includes all the client-side interactivity using vanilla JavaScript. No external frameworks or libraries were used.
* `ASSUMPTIONS.md`: This document details all the design and functionality decisions made by the agent where the source `RESEARCH.md` was not explicit (e.g., color scheme, interactive elements).
* `README.md`: This file.

## Features ‚ú®

The generated website includes several features to enhance user experience:

* **Fully Responsive Design**: The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes using CSS Flexbox and media queries.
* **Sticky Navigation**: A sidebar navigation menu allows users to easily jump to different sections of the report. It remains visible on the screen for easy access on desktop and collapses into a hamburger menu on mobile.
* **Active Section Highlighting**: As the user scrolls through the report, the navigation menu automatically highlights the section currently in view.
* **Interactive Glossary**: The appendix glossary is implemented as an accordion. Users can click on any term to expand it and view the definition, making the long list easy to navigate.
* **Smooth Scrolling**: Internal links provide a smooth scrolling animation for a more pleasant navigation experience.
* **Scroll-to-Top Button**: A convenience button appears when the user scrolls down, allowing them to return to the top of the page with a single click.
